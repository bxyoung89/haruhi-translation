# haruhi-translation

## About
I've been playing more fan translations on my ps2 lately and I figure I'd give it a go. My japanese skills are pretty weak, but I'd like to try google translate then interpreting it anyways. Maybe I'll learn something along the way.

I chose haruhi because I didn't see any roms of it online and it seemed like it'd be fun. Maybe it's a bit much, who knows?
